# Databricks Genie

Create, manage, and query Genie Spaces - natural language interfaces for SQL-based data exploration.

## Overview

Genie Spaces allow users to ask natural language questions about structured data in Unity Catalog. The system translates questions into SQL queries, executes them on a SQL warehouse, and presents results conversationally.

## Creating a Genie Space

### Step 1: Understand the Data

Before creating a Genie Space, explore the available tables to:
- **Select relevant tables** — typically gold layer (aggregated KPIs) and sometimes silver layer (cleaned facts) or metric views
- **Understand the story** — what business questions can this data answer? What insights can users discover?
- **Design meaningful sample questions** — questions should reflect real use cases and lead to actionable insights in the data

Use `discover-schema` as the default — one call returns columns, types, sample rows, null counts, and row count. If you only know the schema, list tables first with `query "SHOW TABLES IN ..."`.

`databricks experimental aitools tools discover-schema catalog.schema.gold_sales catalog.schema.gold_customers`

For Genie, knowing column distribution shapes the sample questions and text instructions. If you don't already know the data, probe cardinality, ranges, and top categorical values with aggregate SQL through `databricks experimental aitools tools query --warehouse <WH> "..."` so your sample questions reflect what's actually in the data. Both commands auto-pick the default warehouse; set `DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID` or pass `--warehouse <ID>` to override.

Fan out independent probes (state ∈ `PENDING|RUNNING|SUCCEEDED|FAILED|CANCELED|CLOSED`):

```bash
submit() { databricks api post /api/2.0/sql/statements --json "$(jq -nc --arg w "$1" --arg s "$2" '{warehouse_id:$w,statement:$s,wait_timeout:"0s",on_wait_timeout:"CONTINUE"}')" | jq -r .statement_id; }
SIDS=(); for q in "$@"; do SIDS+=( "$(submit "$WH" "$q")" ); done
for s in "${SIDS[@]}"; do databricks api get "/api/2.0/sql/statements/$s" | jq '{state:.status.state, rows:.result.data_array}'; done
# cancel: databricks api post "/api/2.0/sql/statements/$SID/cancel"
```

### Step 2: Create the Space

Define your space in a local JSON file (e.g., `genie_space.json`) for version control and easy iteration. See "serialized_space Format" below for the full structure.

```bash
# List all Genie Spaces
databricks genie list-spaces

# Create a Genie Space from a local file
# IMPORTANT: sample_questions require a 32-char hex "id" and "question" must be an array
databricks genie create-space --json "{
  \"warehouse_id\": \"WAREHOUSE_ID\",
  \"title\": \"Sales Analytics\",
  \"description\": \"Explore sales data\",
  \"parent_path\": \"/Workspace/Users/you@company.com/genie_spaces\",
  \"serialized_space\": $(cat genie_space.json | jq -c '.' | jq -Rs '.')
}"

# Get space details (with full config)
databricks genie get-space SPACE_ID --include-serialized-space

# By default, after creation, tag the Genie Space to track resources created with this skill
databricks workspace-entity-tag-assignments create-tag-assignment \
  geniespaces SPACE_ID aidevkit_project --tag-value ai-dev-kit

# Delete a Genie Space
databricks genie trash-space SPACE_ID
```

### Step 3: Test and Iterate

Use the Conversation API (section below) to ask questions and verify answers. If answers are inaccurate or incomplete, improve the space — see "Improving a Genie Space" below.

### Export & Import

**Convention:** `genie_space.json` always holds the **parsed** space object (not a JSON-string-encoded blob), so it's readable and editable. At each use site we stringify it with `jq -c '.' | jq -Rs '.'` — same pattern as Step 2 Create and "Improving a Genie Space" below. `jq -r '.serialized_space | fromjson'` on export strips the outer quoting so the file is already a parsed object.

```bash
# Export: extract serialized_space AND unwrap it to a parsed object on disk
databricks genie get-space SPACE_ID --include-serialized-space -o json \
  | jq '.serialized_space | fromjson' > genie_space.json

# Import: same stringify pattern as Step 2 (Create)
databricks genie create-space --json "{
  \"warehouse_id\": \"WAREHOUSE_ID\",
  \"title\": \"Sales Analytics\",
  \"description\": \"Migrated space\",
  \"parent_path\": \"/Workspace/Users/you@company.com/genie_spaces\",
  \"serialized_space\": $(cat genie_space.json | jq -c '.' | jq -Rs '.')
}"
```

### Improving a Genie Space

When Genie answers are inaccurate or incomplete, improve the space by updating questions, SQL examples, or instructions:

```bash
# 1. Edit your local genie_space.json (add questions, fix SQL examples, improve instructions)

# 2. Push updates back to the space
databricks genie update-space SPACE_ID --json "{\"serialized_space\": $(cat genie_space.json | jq -c '.' | jq -Rs '.')}"
```

## serialized_space Format

The `serialized_space` field is a JSON string containing the full space configuration. Six constructs the schema supports, all optional except `version` and `data_sources.tables`:

| Construct | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | top-level | Integer **`2`** (not string `"2"`). |
| `data_sources.tables[]` | top-level | UC tables (or metric views) the space queries. Each has `identifier`, plus optional `column_configs[]` for per-column behavior. |
| `config.sample_questions[]` | top-level | Suggested starter questions shown in the UI. |
| `instructions.example_question_sqls[]` | top-level | Trusted question↔SQL pairs ("when asked X, run this SQL"). |
| `instructions.text_instructions[]` | top-level | Free-form rules ("for revenue questions use table Y", domain glossary, defaults). |
| `instructions.sql_functions[]` | top-level | UC SQL functions the space can call as tools (identifier only). |
| `benchmarks.questions[]` | top-level | Evaluation pairs (`question` + `answer` SQL) for accuracy testing. |

### Field-shape rules

- **`version: 2`** — integer, not a string.
- **All text fields are arrays of strings.** `question`, `content`, `sql`, and `answer[].content` are always lists, never bare strings. Single-element arrays are fine; the platform concatenates them.
- **Every item needs a unique `id`** — 32-character lowercase hex. Uniqueness is enforced **across all lists combined** (a duplicate between e.g. `text_instructions` and `example_question_sqls` is rejected). The platform reassigns IDs server-side on create, so exact values don't matter for creation — only that they're present, 32 chars, and unique.
- **Sort order matters:** `data_sources.tables` must be sorted by `identifier`; `example_question_sqls`, `text_instructions`, `sql_functions`, and `benchmarks.questions` must be sorted by `id`. (`sample_questions` is silently re-sorted server-side.)
- **Omit empty sections entirely** rather than including `[]` — both work, but live exports omit them when empty.
- **Author-time ID convention** (optional, recommended): prefix the 32 chars by section to keep them readable and sorted in authoring order — `1…0001` for sample_questions, `2…` for example_question_sqls, `3…` for text_instructions, `4…` for sql_functions, `5…` for benchmarks. The platform doesn't enforce this; it's just convenient.

### Text Instructions

`text_instructions` make the Genie Space more reliable by explaining:
- **Where to find information** — which tables contain which metrics
- **How to answer specific questions** — when a user asks X, use table Y with filter Z
- **Business context** — definitions, thresholds, and domain knowledge

Well-crafted instructions significantly improve answer accuracy.

          "Monetary values are USD. Round percentages to 1 decimal place."
        ]
      }
    ],
    "sql_functions": [
      {"id": "40000000000000000000000000000001", "identifier": "main.analytics.format_currency"}

  },
  "benchmarks": {
    "questions": [
      {
        "id": "50000000000000000000000000000001",
        "question": ["What was last month's total revenue?"],
        "answer": [{
          "format": "SQL",
          "content": [
            "SELECT SUM(total_revenue) AS revenue FROM main.analytics.gold_daily_sales ",
            "WHERE sale_date >= date_trunc('MONTH', add_months(current_date(), -1)) ",
            "  AND sale_date <  date_trunc('MONTH', current_date())"
          ]
        }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Notes on the example:
- `version` is the integer `2`.
- `data_sources.tables` is sorted by `identifier`. First table shows the `column_configs` extension (per-column toggles for format assistance / entity matching); the other two use the minimal `{"identifier": ...}` form, which is also valid.
- All text payloads (`question`, `content`, `sql`, `answer[].content`) are arrays.
- IDs use the section-prefix scheme (1xxx/2xxx/3xxx/4xxx/5xxx); 32 chars each, unique across all lists.
- `sql_functions[]` references a UC SQL/Python function by `identifier`; the function definition itself lives in UC, not here.
- `benchmarks` is top-level (sibling of `instructions`), not nested under it. Each `answer` is a list of `{format, content}` objects — `"format": "SQL"` is the common case.


## Cross-Workspace Migration

When migrating between workspaces, catalog names often differ. Export the space, remap with `sed`, then import:

```bash
sed -i '' 's/source_catalog/target_catalog/g' genie_space.json
```

Use `DATABRICKS_CONFIG_PROFILE=profile_name` to target different workspaces.

## Conversation API

Ask questions via three CLI primitives: `start-conversation`, `create-message` (follow-ups), and `get-message` (state + SQL + text). `--no-wait` on `start-conversation` / `create-message` returns immediately with `{conversation_id, message_id}`; poll `get-message` until `.status` is `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, or `CANCELLED`. Intermediate states you'll see: `SUBMITTED`, `FILTERING_CONTEXT`, `ASKING_AI`, `EXECUTING_QUERY`.

```bash
# Start a new conversation (async — get IDs back immediately)
databricks genie start-conversation --no-wait SPACE_ID "What were total sales last month?"
# → {"conversation_id": "...", "message_id": "..."}

# Poll state
databricks genie get-message SPACE_ID CONV_ID MSG_ID | jq '{status, error}'

# When COMPLETED, pull the generated SQL and any text reply
databricks genie get-message SPACE_ID CONV_ID MSG_ID \
  | jq '.attachments[] | {sql: .query.query, description: .query.description, text: .text.content}'

# Fetch the query result rows (columns + data_array)
databricks genie get-message-attachment-query-result SPACE_ID CONV_ID MSG_ID ATTACHMENT_ID \
  | jq '{columns: .statement_response.manifest.schema.columns | map({name, type: .type_name}),
         rows: .statement_response.result.data_array}'

# Follow-up in the same conversation (Genie remembers context)
databricks genie create-message --no-wait SPACE_ID CONV_ID "Break that down by region"
```

Start a new conversation for unrelated topics. Use `create-message` (same `CONV_ID`) only for follow-ups on the same topic.

On `FAILED`, `get-message` populates `.error.error` with the underlying error string (e.g. `[INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS] ...`) and `.error.type` (e.g. `SQL_EXECUTION_EXCEPTION`). Attachments may still include `suggested_questions` even when the primary query failed.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `sample_question.id must be provided` | Add 32-char hex UUID `id` to each sample question |
| `Expected an array for question` | Use `"question": ["text"]` not `"question": "text"` |
| No warehouse available | Create a SQL warehouse or provide `warehouse_id` |
| Empty `serialized_space` on export | Requires CAN EDIT permission on the space |
| Tables not found after migration | Remap catalog name in `serialized_space` before import |
| Slow answers / query timeouts | Size up the warehouse attached to the space; simplify or pre-aggregate tall source tables |
| Wrong or empty answers | Add `example_question_sqls` and `text_instructions` — see "Improving a Genie Space" |
