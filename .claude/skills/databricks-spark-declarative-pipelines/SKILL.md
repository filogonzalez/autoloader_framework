description: "Creates, configures, and updates Databricks Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines (SDP/LDP) using serverless compute. Handles data ingestion with streaming tables, materialized views, CDC, SCD Type 2, and Auto Loader ingestion patterns. Use when building data pipelines, working with Delta Live Tables, ingesting streaming data, implementing change data capture, or when the user mentions SDP, LDP, DLT, Lakeflow pipelines, streaming tables, or bronze/silver/gold medallion architectures."

# Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines (SDP)

---

## Critical Rules (always follow)

### Syntax: CREATE OR REFRESH (not CREATE OR REPLACE)
- **MUST** use `CREATE OR REFRESH` for SDP objects:
  - `CREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE` - for streaming tables
  - `CREATE OR REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` - for materialized views
- **NEVER** use `CREATE OR REPLACE` - that is standard SQL syntax, not SDP syntax

### Simplicity First
- **MUST** create the minimal number of tables to solve the task
- Simplicity first: prefer single pipeline even for multi-schema setups - use fully qualified names (`catalog.schema.table`)
- When asked to "create a silver table" or "create a gold table", create **ONE table** - not a multi-layer pipeline
- Don't add intermediate tables, staging tables, or helper views unless explicitly requested
- A silver transformation = 1 streaming table reading from bronze
- A gold aggregation = 1 materialized view reading from silver
- Create bronze→silver→gold chains when the user asks for a "pipeline" or "medallion architecture" or full/detailed ingestion. Otherwise keep it simple - don't over engineer.

### Language Selection
- **MUST** know the language (Python or SQL). For simple task / pipeline / table creation, pick SQL. For complex pipeline with parametrized information, or if the user mentions python-related items pick python. If you have a doubt, ask the user. Stick with that language unless told otherwise.

| User Says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "Python pipeline", "Python SDP", "use Python", "udf", "pandas", "ml inference", "pyspark" | **User wants Python** |
| "SQL pipeline", "SQL files", "use SQL" | **User wants SQL** |
| "Create a simple pipeline", "create a table", "an aggregation" | **Pick SQL as it's simple** |

### Other Rules
- **MUST** create serverless pipelines by default. Only use classic clusters if user explicitly requires R language, Spark RDD APIs, or JAR libraries.
- **MUST** choose the right workflow based on context (see below).
- When the user provides table schema and asks for code, respond directly with the code. Don't ask clarifying questions if the request is clear.

## Tools
- List files in volume: `databricks fs ls dbfs:/Volumes/{catalog}/{schema}/{volume}/{path}` (the `dbfs:` prefix is required even for UC Volume paths)
- Query data: `databricks experimental aitools tools query --warehouse abc123 "SELECT 1 FROM catalog.schema.table"`
- Discover schema: `databricks experimental aitools tools discover-schema catalog.schema.table1 catalog.schema.table2`
- Pipelines CLI: `databricks pipelines create|get|delete|start-update|list-pipelines` or use `databricks pipelines --help` for more options

## Choose Your Workflow

**First, determine which workflow to use:**

### Option A: Standalone New Pipeline Project (use `databricks pipelines init`)

Use this when the user wants to **create a new, standalone SDP project** that will have its own DAB:
- User asks: "Create a new pipeline", "Build me an SDP", "Set up a new data pipeline"
- No existing `databricks.yml` in the workspace
- The pipeline IS the project (not part of a larger demo/app)


Use `databricks pipeline` CLI commands:
```bash
databricks pipelines init --output-dir . --config-file init-config.json
```

**Example init-config.json:**
```json
{
  "project_name": "customer_pipeline",
  "initial_catalog": "prod_catalog",
  "use_personal_schema": "no",
  "initial_language": "sql"
}
```

→ See [1-project-initialization.md](references/1-project-initialization.md)
→ 


### Option B: Pipeline within Existing Bundle (edit the bundle)

Use this when the pipeline is **part of an existing DAB project**:
- There's already a `databricks.yml` file in the project
- User is adding a pipeline to an existing app/demo

→ See [1-project-initialization.md](references/1-project-initialization.md) for adding pipelines to existing bundles

### Option C: Rapid Iteration with CLI (no bundle management, or you'll create the DAB at the end)

Use this when you need to **quickly create, test, and iterate** on a pipeline without managing bundle files:
- User wants to "just run a pipeline and see if it works"
- Part of a larger demo where bundle is managed separately, or the DAB bundle will be created at the end as you want to quickly test the project first
- Prototyping or experimenting with pipeline logic

→ See [2-cli-approach.md](references/2-cli-approach.md) for CLI-based workflow

## Required Checklist

Before writing pipeline code, make sure you have:
```
- [ ] Language selected: Python or SQL
- [ ] Read the syntax basics: **SQL**: Always Read [sql/1-syntax-basics.md](references/sql/1-syntax-basics.md), **Python**: Always Read [python/1-syntax-basics.md](references/python/1-syntax-basics.md)
- [ ] Workflow chosen: Standalone DAB / Existing DAB / CLI iteration
- [ ] Compute type: serverless (default) or classic
- [ ] Schema strategy: single schema with prefixes vs. multi-schema
- [ ] Consider [Multi-Schema Patterns](#multi-schema-patterns) and [Modern Defaults](#modern-defaults)
```

**Then read additional guides based on what the pipeline needs, when you need it:**
| If the pipeline needs... | Read |
|--------------------------|------|
| File ingestion (Auto Loader, JSON, CSV, Parquet) | `references/sql/2-ingestion.md` or `references/python/2-ingestion.md` |
| Kafka, Event Hub, or Kinesis streaming | `references/sql/2-ingestion.md` or `references/python/2-ingestion.md` |
| Deduplication, windowed aggregations, joins | `references/sql/3-streaming-patterns.md` or `references/python/3-streaming-patterns.md` |
| CDC, SCD Type 1/2, or history tracking | `references/sql/4-cdc-patterns.md` or `references/python/4-cdc-patterns.md` |
| Performance tuning, Liquid Clustering | `references/sql/5-performance.md` or `references/python/5-performance.md` |

## Quick Reference

| Concept | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Names** | SDP = Spark Declarative Pipelines = LDP = Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines (all interchangeable) |
| **SQL Syntax** | `CREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE`, `CREATE OR REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` |
| **Python Import** | `from pyspark import pipelines as dp` |
| **Primary Decorators** | `@dp.table()`, `@dp.materialized_view()`, `@dp.temporary_view()` |

### Legacy APIs (Do NOT Use)

| Legacy | Modern Replacement |
|--------|-------------------|
| `import dlt` | `from pyspark import pipelines as dp` |
| `dlt.apply_changes()` | `dp.create_auto_cdc_flow()` |
| `dlt.read()` / `dlt.read_stream()` | `spark.read` / `spark.readStream` |
| `CREATE LIVE XXX` | `CREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE\|MATERIALIZED VIEW` |
| `PARTITION BY` + `ZORDER` | `CLUSTER BY` (Liquid Clustering) |
| `input_file_name()` | `_metadata.file_path` |
| `target` parameter | `schema` parameter |

### Streaming Table vs Materialized View

| Use Case | Type | Pattern |
|----------|------|---------|
| Windowed aggregations (tumbling, sliding, session) | Streaming Table | `FROM stream(source)` + `GROUP BY window()` |
| Full-table aggregations (totals, daily counts) | Materialized View | `FROM source` (no stream wrapper) |
| CDC / SCD Type 2 | Streaming Table | `AUTO CDC INTO` or `dp.create_auto_cdc_flow()` |

Use streaming tables for windowed aggregations to enable incremental processing. Use materialized views for simple aggregations that recompute fully on each refresh.

### Medallion Architecture

| Layer | SDP Pattern | Common Practices |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **Bronze** | `STREAM read_files()` → streaming table | Often adds `_metadata.file_path`, `_ingested_at`. Minimal transforms, append-only. |
| **Silver** | `stream(bronze)` → streaming table | Clean/validate, type casting, quality filters. Prefer `DECIMAL(p,s)` for money. Dedup can happen here or gold. |
| **Gold** | `AUTO CDC INTO` or materialized view | Aggregated, denormalized. SCD/dedup often via `AUTO CDC`. Star schema typically uses `dim_*`/`fact_*`. |

#### Gold Layer: Preserve Key Dimensions

When aggregating data in gold tables, **keep the main business dimensions** to enable flexible analysis. Over-aggregating loses information that analysts may need later.

**Guidance based on context:**
- **If a dashboard is mentioned**: Include all dimensions that appear as filters. Dashboard filters only work if the underlying data has those columns.
- **If analysis by dimension is mentioned** (e.g., "analyze by store", "breakdown by department"): Include those dimensions in the aggregation.
- **If no specific instructions**: Default to keeping key business dimensions (location, department, product line, customer segment, time period) rather than aggregating them away. This preserves flexibility for future analysis.

**Rule of thumb**: If users might want to slice the data by a dimension, include it in the gold table. It's easier to aggregate further in queries than to recover lost dimensions.

**For medallion architecture** (bronze/silver/gold), two approaches work:
- **Flat with naming** (template default): `bronze_*.sql`, `silver_*.sql`, `gold_*.sql`
- **Subdirectories**: `bronze/orders.sql`, `silver/cleaned.sql`, `gold/summary.sql`

Both work with the `transformations/**` glob pattern. Choose based on preference/existing.

## General SDP development guidance

**SQL Example:**
```sql
CREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE bronze_orders
CLUSTER BY (order_date)
AS SELECT *, current_timestamp() AS _ingested_at
FROM STREAM read_files('/Volumes/catalog/schema/raw/orders/', format => 'json');
```

**Python Example:**
```python
from pyspark import pipelines as dp

@dp.table(name="bronze_events", cluster_by=["event_date"])
def bronze_events():
    return spark.readStream.format("cloudFiles").option("cloudFiles.format", "json").load("/Volumes/...")
```

For detailed syntax, see [sql/1-syntax-basics.md](references/sql/1-syntax-basics.md) or [python/1-syntax-basics.md](references/python/1-syntax-basics.md).

## Best Practices (2026)

### Project Structure
- **Standalone pipeline projects**: Use `databricks pipelines init` for Asset Bundle with multi-environment support
- **Pipeline in existing bundle**: Add to `resources/*.pipeline.yml`
- **Rapid iteration/prototyping**: Use CLI/SDK, formalize in bundle later
- See **[1-project-initialization.md](references/1-project-initialization.md)** for project setup details

### Minimal pipeline config pointers
- Define parameters in your pipeline’s configuration and access them in code with spark.conf.get("key").
- In Databricks Asset Bundles, set these under resources.pipelines.<pipeline>.configuration; validate with databricks bundle validate.

### Modern Defaults
- **Always use raw `.sql`/`.py` files for the transformations files** - NO notebooks in your pipeline. Pipeline code must be plain files.
- **Databricks notebook source for explorations** - Use `# Databricks notebook source` format with `# COMMAND ----------` separators for ad-hoc queries. See [scripts/exploration_notebook.py](scripts/exploration_notebook.py).
- **Serverless compute** - Do not use classic clusters unless explicitly required (R, RDD APIs, JAR libraries)
- **Unity Catalog** (required for serverless)
- **CLUSTER BY** (Liquid Clustering), not PARTITION BY with ZORDER - see [sql/5-performance.md](references/sql/5-performance.md) or [python/5-performance.md](references/python/5-performance.md)
- **read_files()** for SQL cloud storage ingestion - always consume a folder, not a single file - see [sql/2-ingestion.md](references/sql/2-ingestion.md)

### Multi-Schema Patterns

**Preferred: One pipeline writing to multiple schemas** using fully qualified table names (`catalog.schema.table`). This keeps dependencies clear and is simpler to manage than multiple pipelines.

- **Python**: `@dp.table(name="catalog.bronze_schema.orders")`
- **SQL**: `CREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE catalog.silver_schema.orders_clean AS ...`

For detailed examples, see **[3-advanced-configuration.md](references/3-advanced-configuration.md#multi-schema-patterns)**.

**Fallback**: If all tables must be in the same schema, use name prefixes (`bronze_*`, `silver_*`, `gold_*`).

---

## Post-Run Validation (Required)

After running a pipeline (via DAB or CLI), you **MUST** validate both the execution status AND the actual data.

### Step 1: Check Pipeline Execution Status

A freshly created pipeline has `state: IDLE` and `latest_updates: null` until you trigger the first run with `start-update`. `list-pipeline-events` returns a bare JSON array (not `{"events": [...]}`). For DAB runs, also check `databricks bundle run` output.

**Create.** For dev/demo, always pass:
- `"continuous": false` — triggered runs, not always-on.
- `"development": true` — faster startup, no retry-on-failure.
- `"pipelines.numUpdateRetryAttempts": "0"` + `"pipelines.maxFlowRetryAttempts": "0"` — belt-and-suspenders: even with development mode, some configs still retry. Setting both to `"0"` makes a doomed update fail once (in ~30s) instead of retrying 5+ times over 10 min with the same root cause. Defaults (5 / 2) are correct for production, NOT for iteration.

```bash
databricks pipelines create --json '{
  "name": "my_pipeline",
  "catalog": "my_catalog",
  "schema": "my_schema",
  "serverless": true,
  "continuous": false,
  "development": true,
  "channel": "PREVIEW",
  "configuration": {
    "pipelines.numUpdateRetryAttempts": "0",
    "pipelines.maxFlowRetryAttempts": "0"
  },
  "libraries": [{"glob": {"include": "/Workspace/Users/me@example.com/my_pipeline/**"}}]
}'
```

For production pipelines, drop `development` and the retry overrides — defaults exist to absorb transient infra failures.

For dedicated clusters, notifications, autoscaling, event-log routing, restart windows, and Python dependencies, see [3-advanced-configuration.md](references/3-advanced-configuration.md).

**Before submitting**, verify `CLUSTER BY` columns are numeric / string / date / timestamp by `DESCRIBE`-ing each source. SDP doesn't pre-validate this — the pipeline runs, then fails on first write with `DELTA_CLUSTERING_COLUMNS_DATATYPE_NOT_SUPPORTED` (BOOLEAN / ARRAY / MAP / STRUCT / BINARY are not data-skipping types).

**Start + poll.** Capture the `update_id` from `start-update` and poll *that* update — not `latest_updates[0]`, not top-level pipeline `state`. On FAILED, stop immediately and read the events log.

```bash
# --full-refresh reprocesses everything from scratch (destructive on streaming
# state); omit for incremental.
UPDATE_ID=$(databricks pipelines start-update <pipeline_id> | jq -r .update_id)
# Same with full refresh:
# UPDATE_ID=$(databricks pipelines start-update <pipeline_id> --full-refresh | jq -r .update_id)

# Poll THAT update by id. Stop on the FIRST terminal state — including FAILED.
while :; do
  STATE=$(databricks pipelines get-update <pipeline_id> "$UPDATE_ID" | jq -r '.update.state')
  echo "$(date +%H:%M:%S) update=$UPDATE_ID state=$STATE"
  case "$STATE" in COMPLETED|FAILED|CANCELED) break;; esac
  sleep 30
done

# On FAILED, surface the ACTUAL error message. The top-level event `message`
# field is just "Update X is FAILED" — useless. The real cause lives in
# `error.exceptions[0].message`. If you only see "Update X is FAILED", you're
# querying wrong — re-run with the exception body extracted (below).
databricks pipelines list-pipeline-events <pipeline_id> \
  | jq '[.[] | select(.level=="ERROR") | {
      event_type,
      summary: (.message // "")[0:200],
      exception: ((.error.exceptions[0].message // "no exception body") | .[0:800])
    }] | .[0:5]'
```

If a pipeline is already RUNNING, `start-update` queues the new update; force-stop with `databricks pipelines stop <pipeline_id>` first if needed.

### Updating a Pipeline (edit → re-upload → restart)

Use `--format RAW --overwrite` — pipelines use raw `.sql`/`.py` FILE entries. `--format SOURCE --language SQL|PYTHON` uploads a workspace notebook instead and **notebooks are deprecated for pipelines**; mixing the two on the same path fails with `Cannot overwrite the asset ... due to type mismatch (asked: NOTEBOOK, actual: FILE)`.

```bash
# Single file
databricks workspace import /Workspace/Users/<user>/pipeline/07_gold.sql \
    --file ./src/pipeline/07_gold.sql --format RAW --overwrite

# Whole directory
databricks workspace import-dir ./src/pipeline /Workspace/Users/<user>/pipeline --overwrite
```

After re-uploading, trigger a new run with `databricks pipelines start-update <pipeline_id>` (see Step 1 above for the full polling pattern).

### Step 2: Validate Output Data

Even if the pipeline reports SUCCESS, you **MUST** verify the data is correct:

```bash
# Check schema, row counts, sample data, and null counts for all tables
databricks experimental aitools tools discover-schema \
  my_catalog.my_schema.bronze_orders \
  my_catalog.my_schema.silver_orders \
  my_catalog.my_schema.gold_summary
```

This returns per table: columns/types, 5 sample rows, total_rows count, and null counts per column.

**Check for:**
- Empty tables (row_count = 0) - indicates ingestion or filtering issues
- Unexpected row counts - joins may have exploded or filtered too much
- Missing columns - schema mismatch or transformation errors
- NULL values in key columns - data quality issues

### Step 3: Debug Data Issues

If validation reveals problems, trace upstream to find the root cause:

1. **Start from the problematic table** - identify what's wrong (empty, wrong counts, bad data)
2. **Check its source table** - run `DESCRIBE` and `COUNT(*)` on the upstream table
3. **Trace back to bronze** - continue until you find where the issue originates
4. **Common causes:**
   - Bronze empty → source files missing or path incorrect
   - Silver empty → filter too aggressive or join condition wrong
   - Gold wrong counts → aggregation logic error or duplicate keys
   - Data mismatch → type casting issues or NULL handling

5. **Fix the SQL/Python code**, re-upload, and re-run the pipeline

**Use `discover-schema` for validation** - it returns schema, row counts, sample data, and null counts in a single call.

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"Only SQL, Scala and Python notebooks are supported"** | Use `{"file": {"path": "..."}}` instead of `{"notebook": {"path": "..."}}` for raw SQL files. `notebook` is for Databricks notebook format only. |
| **Empty output tables** | Use `discover-schema` to check upstream tables. Verify source files exist and paths are correct. |
| **Pipeline stuck INITIALIZING** | Normal for serverless, wait a few minutes |
| **"Column not found"** | Check `schemaHints` match actual data |
| **Streaming reads fail** | Use `FROM STREAM read_files(...)` only for file ingestion; use `FROM stream(table)` for table-to-table streams. `FROM STREAM table` (no parens) parses but is legacy DLT — prefer the function form. See [read_files — Usage in streaming tables](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/sql/language-manual/functions/read_files#usage-in-streaming-tables). |
| **Timeout during run** | Use `databricks pipelines get <pipeline_id>` to check status |
| **MV doesn't refresh** | Enable row tracking on source tables |
| **SCD2: query column not found** | Lakeflow uses `__START_AT` and `__END_AT` (double underscore), not `START_AT`/`END_AT`. Use `WHERE __END_AT IS NULL` for current rows. See [sql/4-cdc-patterns.md](references/sql/4-cdc-patterns.md). |
| **AUTO CDC parse error at APPLY/SEQUENCE** | Put `APPLY AS DELETE WHEN` **before** `SEQUENCE BY`. Only list columns in `COLUMNS * EXCEPT (...)` that exist in the source (omit `_rescued_data` unless bronze uses rescue data). Omit `TRACK HISTORY ON *` if it causes "end of input" errors; default is equivalent. See [sql/4-cdc-patterns.md](references/sql/4-cdc-patterns.md). |
| **"Cannot create streaming table from batch query"** | In a streaming table query, use `FROM STREAM read_files(...)` so `read_files` leverages Auto Loader; `FROM read_files(...)` alone is batch. See [sql/2-ingestion.md](references/sql/2-ingestion.md) and [read_files — Usage in streaming tables](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/sql/language-manual/functions/read_files#usage-in-streaming-tables). |
| **"Paths must end with .py or .sql"** on `pipelines create` | `{"file": {"path": ...}}` needs a single file. Use `{"glob": {"include": "<dir>/**"}}` for a directory, or enumerate files individually. |
| **`type mismatch (asked: NOTEBOOK, actual: FILE)`** on `workspace import` | Existing path is a FILE (raw `.sql`/`.py`). Re-upload with `--format RAW --overwrite`, not `--format SOURCE --language SQL` (creates a NOTEBOOK — deprecated for pipelines). |

**For detailed errors**, use `databricks pipelines get <pipeline_id>` which includes recent events, or `databricks pipelines list-pipeline-events <pipeline_id>` for full event history.

---

## Platform Constraints

### Serverless Pipeline Requirements (Default)
| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Unity Catalog** | Required - serverless pipelines always use UC |
| **Workspace Region** | Must be in serverless-enabled region |
| **Serverless Terms** | Must accept serverless terms of use |
| **CDC Features** | Requires serverless (or Pro/Advanced with classic clusters) |

### Serverless Limitations (When Classic Clusters Required)
| Limitation | Workaround |
|------------|-----------|
| **R language** | Not supported - use classic clusters if required |
| **Spark RDD APIs** | Not supported - use classic clusters if required |
| **JAR libraries** | Not supported - use classic clusters if required |
| **Maven coordinates** | Not supported - use classic clusters if required |
| **DBFS root access** | Limited - must use Unity Catalog external locations |
| **Global temp views** | Not supported |

### General Constraints
| Constraint | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Schema Evolution** | Streaming tables require full refresh for incompatible changes |
| **SQL Limitations** | PIVOT clause unsupported |
| **Sinks** | Python only, streaming only, append flows only |

**Default to serverless** unless user explicitly requires R, RDD APIs, or JAR libraries.
